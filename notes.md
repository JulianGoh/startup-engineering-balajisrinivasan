- "Startups in the past" as a concept - not a 1990s/2000s invention
    - Features of these early industries in 1800s/1900s America:
        - Low cost of capital to start
        - Open regulatory, technological and physical frontiers
    - Startups lose their edge when they are slow and/or regulations present barriers to entry 
    - S-curve suggests 10-year gap between Cambrian explosion to maturation
- Startups in the present
    - Wide spread base technology innovation (TCP/IP, WWW), Silicon Valley VC *plus* the global shift towards free markets with the collapse of the Soviet Union
- Key features of internet startups
    - Operational scalability - online stores can operate 24/7 without regard for zoning regulations, without in-store clerks, without a physical storefront
    - Market size - from local to global addressable market size
    - Generality - "Software is Eating the World" - "You have an incredibly powerful desktop manufacturing device on your desk, a kind of *virtual* 3D printer before its time, whose price is now within reach of even the world's poorest.
    - Low capital barriers - a) extremely sophisticated general purpose computers, b) develop arbitrary software and c) communicate with any other computer in the world
    - Low regulatory barriers
    - Open source - The internet is built on open source technologies
    - The long tail - **Never in the history of mankind have so many (l)earned so much from so few**
    - Failure tolerance - "move fast and break things"
- "Startup engineering" - getting something to work *well enough* for people to buy
    - One of the primary things a startup engineer does is *systems integration* -> keeping up with new tech, **doing quick evaluations** and then snapping the pieces together
